### What is Sellix? 

Sellix is a SaaS eCommerce platform, very similar to Shopify. We have over 250.000 merchants and process thousands of orders daily. Many of our clients asked us to provide them with a WooCommerce plugin for their business, and we're looking to do just so.

With Sellix Pay, customers can quickly checkout and complete orders with their preferred payment method, including cryptocurrencies.

Our plugin can be configured through the Sellix dashboard, with any of the 20+ gateways we offer, along with every security feature and addons we provide.

Additionally, you can fully integrate with our other services should your business require you to, without having to choose any other plugin.

Powered by our fraud prevention software Fraud Shield, Sellix ensures the stability and security of your products all day, all night. Stop blocking legitimate customers, and start blocking fraudulent customers.

Ditch platforms that fail to protect your integrity as a digital entrepreneur. We use world-class software to power our security apparatus as well as using protection that scales with you.

### How to use the plugin? 

Sellix Pay can be configured easily, the only input required is the Sellix.io API key.

Once set, any payment method can be enabled (if configured properly on the dashboard) and will be automatically displayed during checkout.
    
Customers will then be prompted to choose their payment method amongst the ones available, like shown in the below picture.

Once chosen, the customer will be redirected to the Sellix checkout page where the order takes place, as soon as the transaction is sent the order will then be marked as completed.
